/**
 * Colocated SVGs Astro's image pipeline can't measure. Astro reads an image's
 * size before it optimizes it, and for an SVG it looks for the `<svg>` tag in
 * the file's first 1,000 bytes only, then needs a width and height or a
 * viewBox on that tag. A draw.io export carries its whole diagram in a
 * `content` attribute on the tag, which pushes the tag's end past that
 * window, so one diagram fails the build (`NoImageMetadata`). Blume serves
 * such an SVG as it is instead, from the endpoint that already serves content
 * images to agents (`/blume-assets/content/…`), and warns about it
 * (`BLUME_SVG_UNOPTIMIZED`). A browser draws an SVG at any size, so the
 * only loss is the intrinsic `width`/`height` the optimized `<img>` carries.
